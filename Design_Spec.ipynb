Consensys Spec
Summary
The following is the work in progress towards the spec for the consensys system. There is still much left to do and fill in but this should serve as an introduction to some of the system specification.

Purpose of the Spec
The spec is dynamic allowing for easily linking and changing policies and mechanisms. In the current form we have the actions that take place, and then we can iterate on candidate policies that specify the exact logic.

State Definitions
As more actions are mapped, the states that need to be tracked for each entity are updated.

Behavioral Actions
These are any of the behaviors that we see an entity calling to initiate a chain of actions.

Policies
These are the blocks that take a message and map out what policies or mechanisms to call next as well as the new messages to pass to them. This is where logic such as exchange rates, quality of service metrics, etc would happen. The policy options are the specific implementations of the policy.

Mechanisms
These are the blocks that update state in the system.

Messages
These are the inputs/outputs passed between behavioral actions, policies, and mechanisms.
